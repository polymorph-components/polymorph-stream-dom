// Serialization of host->guest `handle-event` entries.
//
// The host may only enter the guest component instance when no guest
// activation is live. There are THREE windows in which a naive, synchronous
// dispatch from a DOM listener would violate that, and all three are
// reachable from ordinary app code:
//
//   1. A `handle-event` call is in flight. The guest's own synchronous DOM
//      mutations (issued mid-call, before the call's promise settles — e.g.
//      `replaceWith`ing a focused `<input>` out of the DOM) make the browser
//      fire a SECOND, synchronous native event (`focusout`/`blur`) while the
//      first entry is still on the stack. Entering the instance again there
//      is forbidden by the component model (observed: "Trap: cannot enter
//      component instance 0 (reentrance forbidden)").
//
//   2. A scheduler-driven mutation flush. When the guest re-renders off its
//      own timer/async work — no `handle-event` in flight at all — the
//      mutation batch arrives through the mutation stream's read session
//      (mount.ts's `stream.readDirect` callback resumption), and DOM
//      application happens synchronously INSIDE that resumption, i.e.
//      inside the guest's stream-write rendezvous. A live guest activation
//      is on the stack: the instance's reentrance bracket is turn-scoped,
//      taken around every thread resumption and released only when the
//      thread parks (.deps/polyengine/runtime/src/task/thread.ts `resumeWith`, and
//      exec/boundary.ts's matching bracket). So a native event fired by the
//      mutation itself would enter the guest from inside a live turn — the
//      same trap, with nothing "in flight" by the window-1 bookkeeping.
//
//   3. A host IMPORT invoked by the guest. `queries.set-focus`
//      (wit/stream-dom.wit, `interface queries`) runs host code while the
//      guest that called it is still on the stack, and `.focus()`/`.blur()`
//      fire `focusout`/`focusin` SYNCHRONOUSLY — delegated events this host
//      would otherwise dispatch straight back into that same live
//      activation. Same class as window 2 (host code running inside a
//      guest turn), reached from the other direction. The mechanism is
//      unchanged: mount.ts's `setFocus` brackets its body with
//      `beginApply`/`endApply`, so dispatches raised by the focus change
//      queue and drain once the guest's turn unwinds.
//
// Window 2 also risks a memory-safety hazard if guest code were run inside
// it: `stream.readDirect`'s callback holds a `DirectSource` view that
// aliases guest linear memory for the duration of the callback
// (contracts/embedder-api.md "Streams and futures", "Direct-access byte
// edges") — running guest code mid-application would both reenter the
// instance (forbidden) and observe or corrupt that view mid-copy, which is
// what the gate's bracket around the whole callback prevents.
//
// Why deferring to a microtask is sound: microtasks run only when the JS
// stack is empty, and a guest turn holds the stack until it parks or
// completes. Since the reentrance bracket is turn-scoped, an empty stack
// implies no live turn, hence an enterable instance. A drain deferred with
// `queueMicrotask` therefore always runs in a legal window — no polling, no
// timers, and it lands at the earliest legal moment.
//
// Caveat: `preventDefault` semantics are lost for DEFERRED dispatches. The
// browser has already decided whether to honor the default by the time the
// queued entry runs. This is inherent to any deferral (it was already true
// of the pre-existing in-flight queue), and the events that actually
// trigger deferral are focusout-class events with no meaningful default.
// The idle path stays synchronous precisely to keep `preventDefault`
// working for the common case, where the dispatch happens inside the
// native listener's own frame.
